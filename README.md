# Hash-Table-with-AVL-Tree
Developed a Hash Table in C++ by using an AVL as a structure for separate chaining in collision resolution. This is done in order to maintain a O(log N) time complexity. A very useful construct for prefect hashing as well as databases in order to optimize searches in a big database.
